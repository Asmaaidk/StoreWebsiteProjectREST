RESTful API using Django - StoreWebsite

<hr>

This project is centered around the development of a RESTful API using Django and the Django REST Framework (DRF). The aim is to illustrate the implementation of various core concepts such as Django setup, model serialization, authentication, routers, and the use of generic or model viewsets. The project is designed to adhere to best practices in API development and provides a comprehensive example of a fully functional API system.

### Setting Up Django Environment: 
The initial phase involves the establishment of a Django environment. This includes the installation of Django and Django REST Framework, followed by the creation of a new Django project and app. The database configurations is defined.

### Implementing Model Serializers: 
The next step involves the utilization of model serializers.

### Integrating Authentication Mechanisms: 
Integrating authentication is a crucial step in ensuring secure access to the API. This process involves setting up and configuring authentication classes in Django REST Framework. 

### Applying Routers for URL Management: 
Routers are employed to manage URL structures in a Django REST Framework application.

### Utilizing Generic or Model Viewsets: 
The final task involves the application of generic or model viewsets. Viewsets in Django REST Framework are classes that provide the logic to get, update, and delete models. The use of generic or model viewsets simplifies the process of creating views that interact with the database. They allow for the concise and efficient definition of common patterns for read and write operations against the database.
